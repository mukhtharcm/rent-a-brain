      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why use it?</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Your thoughts have thoughts. And those thoughts have to-do lists.</li>
        <li>You accidentally thought about your ex, your taxes, and mortality at once.</li>
        <li>You need someone to store your "million-dollar" ideas like "Tinder for plants" or "AI-powered toast."</li>
        <li>You just want to vibe, not overanalyze that one message from 3 years ago.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How it works (in theory)</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>You imagine signing up.</li>
        <li>You get paired with a rental brainâ€”could be a human, AI, or a mildly intelligent potato.</li>
        <li>You dump your thoughts. The brain nods, possibly writes a novel with them.</li>
        <li>You feel lighter. Your original brain says "thank you."
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How to get started?</h2>
